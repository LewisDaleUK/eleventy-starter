# Eleventy Starter

An Eleventy starter kit to make it easier to get new websites set up quickly with all of my tooling included.

Includes:
* Base CSS for common components, including grids, lists, and galleries
* Macros for banners and galleries
* Fluid type and font scales
* Shortcodes for images and custom categories
  
The included CSS methodology is _heavily_ inspired by [Build Excellent Websites by Andy Bell](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es)
